# Tutorial Regex

Regular expressions, commonly referred to as regex, are a powerful tool used for pattern matching within text. They provide a concise and flexible way to search, extract, and manipulate strings based on specific patterns or rules. With regex, you can perform a wide range of text processing tasks, such as validating input, searching for specific patterns within text, extracting relevant information, and performing complex text transformations. While regex syntax may appear daunting at first, mastering it opens up a world of possibilities for efficient and precise text manipulation in various programming languages and text editors.

## Summary

Regex: (?<=\d{3})\d{3}(?=\d{4})

Explanation: This regex pattern matches a sequence of three digits that are preceded by another sequence of three digits and followed by a sequence of four digits.

## Regex Components

Regex components refers to the specific pieces that create a regular expression. Examples include [Anchors](#anchors), [Bracket Expressions](#bracket-expressions), [Quantifiers](#quantifiers), [Grouping Constructs](#grouping-and-capturing), [OR Operator](#or-operator), [Character Classes](#character-classes), and [Flags](#flags).

### Anchors

Anchors in regular expressions are symbols or characters that allow you to match a pattern only at certain positions within the text being searched. Anchors are useful for specifying precisely where in the text a pattern should match, allowing for more accurate and targeted searches or replacements in text processing tasks.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers in regular expressions specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class should be matched. Quantifiers help to specify the repetition of patterns in a regular expression, making it more powerful and flexible for matching various text patterns.

### OR Operator

The OR operator in regular expressions allows you to specify alternatives for matching within a pattern. It's represented by the vertical bar symbol |. The OR operator enables you to create more flexible and comprehensive patterns by allowing multiple options for matching within a single expression.

### Character Classes

Character classes, also known as character sets or character ranges, allow you to match any one character from a set of characters. Character classes provide a concise way to match specific sets of characters within a regular expression, making pattern matching more efficient and flexible.

### Flags

Flags in regular expressions (regex) are special parameters or options that modify the behavior of the regex engine during pattern matching. Flags provide flexibility and control over how regex patterns are applied, allowing for more precise and efficient matching in various text processing tasks.

### Grouping and Capturing

Grouping and capturing in regular expressions (regex) allow you to treat multiple characters as a single unit and capture the matched text for later use. Grouping and capturing are powerful features in regex that allow you to structure complex patterns, apply quantifiers more precisely, and extract specific information from matched text. They are commonly used in text processing tasks such as data extraction, validation, and transformation.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions, also known as character classes or character sets, allow you to specify a set of characters that you want to match within a regular expression. Bracket expressions provide a concise way to match specific sets of characters within a regular expression, making pattern matching more efficient and flexible.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Certainly! Greedy and lazy matching refer to the behavior of quantifiers in regular expressions. Greedy matching is the default behavior, but in some cases, lazy matching is more appropriate, especially when you want to match the smallest possible substring or when working with quantifiers that are consuming too much text. Using lazy quantifiers appropriately can lead to more efficient and accurate pattern matching in regular expressions.

### Boundaries

Boundaries in regular expressions (regex) are positions in the text where certain conditions are met. They don't match any characters themselves but rather assert whether a particular condition is true at a specific position. Boundaries in regex are essential for specifying precise locations where patterns should match within the text, allowing for more accurate and targeted searches or replacements. They provide finer control over pattern matching behavior and are commonly used in text processing tasks.

### Back-references

Back-references in regular expressions (regex) allow you to refer back to previously captured groups within the pattern. Back-references are a powerful feature in regex that allows for more complex pattern matching and replacement tasks, especially when dealing with repeated or duplicated text patterns. They enable you to create more precise and efficient regular expressions for various text processing tasks.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead and look-behind assertions are advanced features in regular expressions (regex) that allow you to assert specific conditions without consuming characters in the match. Look-ahead and look-behind assertions are powerful tools in regex for specifying complex conditions for pattern matching, allowing for more precise and flexible text processing tasks.
